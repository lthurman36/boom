          <p>It all started with game nites. Busting out our candy bin, putting on our 80 &#39;s playlist. That led to an obsession with trying to find the best candies to put in the bin... which converted me to the gummy camp. Boom Box Candy was born when I realized that gummies could get any party started with the right presentation &#8212; a presentation that makes an exciting impression &#8212; an impression that goes &#34;BOOM baby!&#34; I hope you love the Boom Box experience, designed to bring that fun surprise to any occasion.</p>
